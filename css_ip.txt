1. What is CSS?
It's a stylesheet language that is used to determine or decide how the elements in a HTML page should look or show in screen. 

2. What is the Box model in CSS? 
Every element in a HTML page is basically a rectangular box with some width and height, padding, border and margin.

3. How to include CSS in HTML?
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyles.css" />

<style type="text/css">

/*Add style rules here*/

</style>

<h2 style="color:red;background:black">Inline Style</h2>

4. What are the different types of Selectors in CSS?

* - universal selector
 name of selector eg. ul - Element Type Selector

#container - ID Selector

.box - class selector

#container .box - descendent selector (.box inside #container gets modified. child and grandchilds are affected)

#container> .box - child selector (.box inside #container gets modified. only childs are affected, not grandchilds)

div + p - adjacent sibling selector 

h2 ~ p - general sibling selector 

input [type=”text”] - attribute selector


5. Inline vs inline-block vs block

Inline elements:

respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
cannot have a width and height set
allow other elements to sit to their left and right.
see very important side notes on this here.

Block elements:

respect all of those
force a line break after the block element
acquires full-width if width not defined

Inline-block elements:

allow other elements to sit to their left and right
respect top & bottom margins and padding
respect height and width

6. Pseudo elements
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

::before
::after
::first-letter
::first-line
::selection

7. Pseudo classes

:link
:visited
:hover
:active
:focus

8. position

Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. 

An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

9. right property

The effect of right depends on how the element is positioned (i.e., the value of the position property):

When position is set to absolute or fixed, the right property specifies the distance between the element's outer margin of right edge and the inner border of the right edge of its containing block.
When position is set to relative, the right property specifies the distance the element's right edge is moved to the left from its normal position.
When position is set to sticky, the right property is used to compute the sticky-constraint rectangle.
When position is set to static, the right property has no effect.
