diff vs log vs status

git diff :
git diff command will display any changes made since you last committed.
git diff is between index (staging area) and working tree.


git status:
This command lets us gather information such as:

	If the branch we're on is up to date
	Any files that are staged, unstaged or untracked
	Any files that have been created, modified or deleted
	If there is anything to commit, pull or push


git log :
 git log will display the commit history for your branch.

git log -n <limit>
git log --oneline
git log <filename>


Git status vs Git log
While git status gave information about the current working directory, git log will display the commit history for your branch.
