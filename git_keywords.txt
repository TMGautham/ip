atomic commit - commit only one thing at a time. it will be useful in case we want to undo.

untracked file - file that is not added to staging area

git log - history of commits

how to skip staging area? : git commit -a -m "add file file.html"

how to unstage a staged file? git restore â€“staged file-to-unstage.txt

how to delete a branch after merging?
git branch -d branchname

how to delete a branch without merging?
git branch -D branchname

Can we switch to another branch while having untracked files in the current branch?

git fetch -> fetches from remote repo and puts it in the local repo but does not put it in working directory
We will need to use git merge to make it show in the working directory.

git pull = git fetch + git merge

fast-forward in git is a way of merging

git stash
git stash save
all the above 2 are same

get the list of all stashes
git stash list 

go back to previous commit
git clean -f -d


get details of what happened in a commit
got show commit_id


change previous commit message
git commit --amend
